          Allow me to share a meaningful quote from Lao Tzu: &quot;
          <span className="text-teal-500">
            A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
          </span>
          .&quot; While the odyssey ahead may appear daunting and seemingly endless,
          I firmly believe that each of us possesses the capability to proceed one
          step at a time, and that progress is attained through steady momentum. As
          we navigate this route, we may encounter numerous obstacles and
          uncertainties, but by maintaining determination and focusing on the
          present moment, we can overcome any challenge that crosses our path.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300">
          May today mark the beginning of our incredible journey.
